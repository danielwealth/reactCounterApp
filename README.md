# reactCounterApp
We create a `Counter` component using the `useState` hook to store and update the counter value.
- We define two state variables: `count` to store the current counter value and `message` to display a message when the counter reaches a certain threshold.
- We create two functions: `handleIncrease` to increment the counter and `handleDecrease` to decrement the counter.
- We use conditional statements to prevent the counter from going below zero and to display a message when the counter reaches a certain threshold (in this case, 10).
- We render the counter value, increase and decrease buttons, and a message (if any) in the component's JSX.
